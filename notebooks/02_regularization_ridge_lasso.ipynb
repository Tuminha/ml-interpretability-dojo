    "# Notebook 02: Regularization (Ridge & Lasso)\n\n## The Art of Restraint\n\nOverfitting is the enemy of generalization. Regularization tames it by penalizing complexity. Ridge shrinks coefficients smoothly. Lasso can zero them out entirely, performing automatic feature selection.\n\n### Why Regularize?\n\n- **Bias-variance tradeoff**: Reduce variance (overfitting) at the cost of slight bias\n- **Multicollinearity**: When features are correlated, coefficients become unstable\n- **Feature selection**: Lasso can automatically select important features\n\n### Ridge vs Lasso\n\n- **Ridge (L2)**: Penalizes sum of squared coefficients. Shrinks all coefficients toward zero, but rarely sets them to exactly zero.\n- **Lasso (L1)**: Penalizes sum of absolute coefficients. Can set coefficients to exactly zero, performing feature selection.\n\nWe use cross-validation to pick the regularization strength (alpha)."
