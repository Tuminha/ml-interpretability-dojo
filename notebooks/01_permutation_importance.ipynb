        "## Breaking the Connection to Measure Impact\n",
        "\n",
        "In the previous notebook, we learned that shuffling rows shouldn't change predictions. Now we'll use a similar idea—but more strategically—to measure **feature importance**.\n",
        "\n",
        "Permutation importance answers a simple question: *\"What happens to model performance when we break the association between a feature and the target?\"*\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## The Core Idea\n",
        "\n",
        "### Intuition\n",
        "\n",
        "Imagine you're predicting house prices, and one of your features is \"number of bedrooms.\" This feature is clearly important—houses with more bedrooms tend to cost more.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now, what if we randomly shuffle the \"bedrooms\" column? We break the connection between bedrooms and price. If the model's performance drops significantly, bedrooms were important. If performance barely changes, bedrooms didn't matter much.\n",
        "\n",
        "### The Algorithm\n",
        "\n",
        "Permutation importance works as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Train a model** on the original data and record baseline performance (e.g., RMSE, R²)\n",
        "2. **For each feature**:\n",
        "   - Create a copy of the test set\n",
        "   - Randomly permute (shuffle) that feature's values\n",
        "   - Make predictions with the permuted feature\n",
        "   - Compute the performance metric\n",
        "   - **Importance = Baseline Performance - Permuted Performance**\n",
        "3. **Rank features** by importance (larger drop = more important)\n",
        "\n",
        "### Mathematical Formulation\n",
        "\n",
        "For a feature $j$, permutation importance is:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\\text{Importance}_j = \\text{Score}(y, \\hat{y}) - \\text{Score}(y, \\hat{y}_{\\text{perm}(j)})$$\n",
        "\n",
        "where:\n",
        "- $\\text{Score}$ is a metric (higher is better, like R²) or negative error (like -RMSE)\n",
        "- $\\hat{y}$ are predictions on original test set\n",
        "- $\\hat{y}_{\\text{perm}(j)}$ are predictions when feature $j$ is permuted\n",
        "\n",
        "**Important**: For error metrics (RMSE, MAE), we typically use the **negative** so that higher values mean more importance:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\\text{Importance}_j = -\\text{RMSE}(y, \\hat{y}_{\\text{perm}(j)}) - (-\\text{RMSE}(y, \\hat{y})) = \\text{RMSE}(y, \\hat{y}) - \\text{RMSE}(y, \\hat{y}_{\\text{perm}(j)})$$\n",

        "\n",
        "### Advantages\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Model-agnostic**: Works with any model (linear, trees, neural networks)\n",
        "2. **Intuitive**: Easy to explain to non-technical stakeholders\n",
        "3. **No retraining**: Fast to compute (just permute and predict)\n",
        "4. **Handles interactions**: Captures feature importance in the context of the full model\n",
        "\n",
        "### Limitations\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Correlated features**: If two features are highly correlated, permuting one might not hurt much because the other carries the signal\n",
        "2. **Computational cost**: Requires multiple predictions (one per feature, often with repeats)\n",
        "3. **Random variation**: Results can vary slightly between runs (use `n_repeats` to average)\n",

        "- Coefficients assume features are independent (often not true)\n",
        "- Coefficients are sensitive to feature scaling\n",

        "- Can be biased toward high-cardinality features\n",
        "- Permutation importance is more reliable for ranking\n",
        "\n",
        "### vs. Label Permutation Test\n",
        "\n",
        "**Important distinction**: Permutation importance permutes **features**, not labels.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Feature permutation**: Breaks feature-target association → measures feature importance\n",

        "1. **Pick a feature** — Choose one that permutation importance identified as important (or unimportant)\n",
        "2. **Create a copy** — Copy the test set so we don't modify the original\n",
        "3. **Permute the feature** — Randomly shuffle that feature's values\n",
        "4. **Make predictions** — Use the permuted test set\n",

        "### What to Expect\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Important feature**: Permuting it should cause a significant drop in R² (or increase in RMSE)\n",

        "### Why is RMSE Different from Notebook 00?\n",
        "\n",
        "You might notice that your RMSE (2899.05) is **much higher** than the RMSE from Notebook 00 (53.85). This is likely because:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Different model**: You're using a **Ridge regression** with `alpha=0.1` in this notebook, while Notebook 00 used plain **LinearRegression** (no regularization)\n",
        "2. **Different scaling**: The Ridge model uses StandardScaler, which might affect how errors are calculated\n",
        "3. **Possible calculation issue**: If RMSE is extremely high, check:\n",
        "   - Are you using the correct `y_test` (unscaled target values)?\n",
        "   - Are predictions in the same scale as `y_test`?\n",
        "   - The pipeline should handle scaling automatically, but verify predictions match the scale of `y_test`\n",

        "**Important**: The absolute RMSE value matters less than the **relative change** when permuting. What matters is:\n",
        "- **RMSE increased** from 2899 → 5537 (almost doubled!)\n",
        "- This large increase shows the feature is important\n",

        "\n",
        "In this notebook, we've learned how to measure feature importance using permutation importance—a powerful, model-agnostic technique.\n",

        "### Key Takeaways\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Permutation importance measures feature impact** by breaking the feature-target association through random shuffling\n",
        "2. **Model-agnostic**: Works with any model (linear, trees, neural networks)\n",
        "3. **Context-aware**: Measures importance in the context of the full model, not in isolation\n",
        "4. **Multiple repeats reduce variance**: Use `n_repeats` to get stable estimates\n",
        "5. **Visualization is key**: Bar plots make it easy to see which features matter most\n",
        "\n",
        "### When to Use Permutation Importance\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Initial feature ranking**: Quick way to see which features drive performance\n",
        "- **Model debugging**: If an \"important\" feature has low permutation importance, investigate why\n",
        "- **Feature selection**: Identify features that can be safely removed\n",
        "- **Stakeholder communication**: Easy to explain (\"if we shuffle this feature, performance drops by X%\")\n",
        "\n",
        "### Limitations to Remember\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Correlated features**: If two features are highly correlated, permuting one might not hurt much\n",
        "- **Computational cost**: Requires multiple predictions (can be slow for large datasets)\n",
        "- **Random variation**: Results can vary between runs (use `n_repeats` to stabilize)\n",
        "\n",
        "### Next Steps\n",
        "\n",
        "**Next**: Notebook 02 will explore regularization (Ridge and Lasso) to understand how we can:\n",
        "- Control model complexity through regularization\n",
        "- Perform automatic feature selection with Lasso\n",
        "- Use cross-validation to find optimal hyperparameters\n",
        "- Compare Ridge vs Lasso for different scenarios\n",
        "\n",
