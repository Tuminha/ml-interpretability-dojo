*Building durable intuition for model interpretability, one concept at a time*

</div>

## 🎯 The Journey

Imagine you've built a machine learning model that predicts patient outcomes with 95% accuracy. Impressive, right? But here's the question that keeps data scientists awake at night: **Why does it work?** What features drive the predictions? Can we trust it when it matters most?

This dojo is born from a simple realization: **understanding your model is not optional—it's essential**. Whether you're deploying in healthcare, finance, or any domain where decisions have consequences, interpretability bridges the gap between black-box predictions and actionable insights.

Through seven carefully crafted notebooks, we'll explore four pillars of model understanding:

1. **Invariance and Baselines** — Establishing what "normal" looks like
2. **Permutation Importance** — Measuring feature impact through controlled chaos
3. **Regularization (Ridge & Lasso)** — Taming complexity and selecting what matters
4. **Multicollinearity & PCA** — Diagnosing redundancy and finding structure
5. **SHAP Values** — Unpacking predictions into feature contributions
6. **Cross-Validation & Leakage** — Ensuring our insights are real, not artifacts

Each notebook is designed as a learning journey: 70% explanation, 30% guided implementation. You'll code the solutions yourself, because **understanding comes from doing**.

## 📚 The Path

### Notebook 00: Invariance and Baselines ✅
**The Foundation** — Before we interpret complex models, we must understand what makes a model "well-behaved." Invariance teaches us that row order shouldn't matter. Baselines teach us what "random" looks like. Together, they form the bedrock of model evaluation.

**Key Concepts:**
- Row-order invariance in tabular models
- Mean predictor and majority class baselines
- Reproducibility through random seeds

**Results:**
- Baseline Linear Regression on Diabetes Dataset:
  - **RMSE**: 53.85 (average prediction error in disease progression units)
  - **R²**: 0.4526 (explains 45.26% of variance)
  - Model demonstrates row-order invariance ✓
  - Performance beats naive baseline (mean predictor) ✓

*Distribution of target values and predictions vs actual scatter plot*

</div>

### Notebook 01: Permutation Importance ✅
**Breaking the Connection** — What happens when we randomly shuffle a feature? If the model's performance barely changes, that feature carries little signal. Permutation importance quantifies this intuition, giving us a model-agnostic way to rank features by their predictive power.

**Key Concepts:**
- Feature-target association breaking
- Metric drop as importance signal
- Difference from label permutation tests

**Results:**
- Permutation importance computed on Ridge regression model (R² = 0.4528)
- **Top 3 Most Important Features**:
  1. `s1` (blood serum): 0.609 importance (R² drop when permuted)
  2. `s5` (blood serum): 0.464 importance
  3. `s2` (blood serum): 0.227 importance
- Manual verification: Permuting `s1` caused R² to drop from 0.45 to -0.05 (model worse than baseline!)
- Key insight: Blood serum measurements (`s1`, `s5`, `s2`) are critical biomarkers for diabetes progression

</div>

### Notebook 02: Regularization (Ridge & Lasso) ✅
**The Art of Restraint** — Overfitting is the enemy of generalization. Regularization tames it by penalizing complexity. Ridge shrinks coefficients smoothly. Lasso can zero them out entirely, performing automatic feature selection. Understanding when to use each is a superpower.

**Key Concepts:**
- Bias-variance tradeoff
- L1 (Lasso) vs L2 (Ridge) penalties
- Coefficient shrinkage vs selection
- Cross-validation for hyperparameter tuning

**Results:**
- **Ridge Regression**: Best α = 1.23, R² = 0.4544, RMSE = 53.77
  - All 10 features retained (no feature selection)
  - Top features: `s5` (30.74), `bmi` (25.75), `bp` (16.72)
- **Lasso Regression**: Best α = 1.56, R² = 0.4713, RMSE = 52.93
  - **Automatic feature selection**: 3 features set to zero (`age`, `s2`, `s4`)
  - Top features: `bmi` (26.20), `s5` (22.09), `bp` (15.13)
- **Key Finding**: Lasso performs slightly better (R²: 0.471 vs 0.454) while using only 7 features instead of 10
- **Insight**: Lasso's feature selection identifies that `age`, `s2`, and `s4` are redundant for this model

*Side-by-side comparison showing Lasso's sparsity (zero coefficients) vs Ridge's smooth shrinkage*

</div>

### Notebook 03: Multicollinearity & PCA ✅
**The Redundancy Problem** — When features are highly correlated, coefficients become unstable and hard to interpret. Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) diagnoses the problem. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) reveals the underlying structure, rotating data to uncorrelated axes.

**Key Concepts:**
- Correlation matrices and VIF interpretation
- PCA as a diagnostic tool
- Explained variance and component loadings
- When to use PCA vs feature engineering

**Results:**
- **VIF Analysis**: Found 4 features with high multicollinearity (`s1`, `s2`, `s3`, `s5` with VIF > 10)
- **PCA Dimensionality Reduction**: 7 principal components explain 90% of variance
  - Reduced from 10 features to 7 components
  - Each component is a linear combination of ALL 10 original features
- **Model Comparison** (Ridge Regression):
  - **PCA (7 components)**: RMSE = 53.64, R² = 0.457, MAE = 42.90
  - **Original (10 features)**: RMSE = 53.77, R² = 0.454, MAE = 42.81
  - **Key Finding**: Nearly identical performance! PCA successfully reduced dimensionality without losing predictive power
- **Insight**: For small datasets (10 features), PCA benefits are minimal, but validates that 7 components capture 90% of information

*Side-by-side comparison showing PCA maintains performance with fewer dimensions*

</div>

### Notebook 04: SHAP Values ✅
**The Attribution Game** — SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) answers: "How much did each feature contribute to this specific prediction?" It's based on game theory, ensuring local attributions sum to the prediction minus baseline. Different explainers for different models, each with tradeoffs.

**Key Concepts:**
- Shapley values from cooperative game theory
- LinearExplainer for linear models
- TreeExplainer for tree ensembles
- Local vs global interpretability
- Performance considerations and sampling

**Results:**
- **Linear Model (Ridge)**: SHAP values computed using LinearExplainer
  - **Model**: Ridge regression (α = 0.1) with StandardScaler
  - **Background Sample**: 353 rows (all available training data)
  - **Top 5 Features by Mean Absolute SHAP Value**:
    1. **`s1`**: 33.17 (most impactful feature)
    2. **`s5`**: 28.79 (second most important)
    3. **`bmi`**: 22.83 (third most important)
    4. **`s2`**: 18.96 (fourth)
    5. **`bp`**: 13.53 (fifth)
- **Tree Model (XGBoost)**: SHAP values computed using TreeExplainer
  - **Model**: XGBRegressor (n_estimators=200, max_depth=3)
  - **Top 3 Features**: `bmi`, `s5`, `s3` (tree models capture non-linear interactions)
- **SHAP vs Permutation Importance Comparison**:
  - **Strong Agreement**: 4 out of 5 top features overlap (`s1`, `s5`, `bmi`, `s2`)
  - **Differences**: SHAP ranks `bp` #5, Permutation ranks `sex` #5
  - **Key Insight**: SHAP captures local (per-prediction) contributions, while permutation importance measures global (overall model) impact
- **Directionality Insights**:
  - **Positive impact**: `s1`, `s5`, `bmi`, `bp` — high values increase predictions
  - **Negative impact**: `s2`, `s4` — high values decrease predictions (inverse relationship)

### Interpreting the SHAP Plots

**How to Read SHAP Summary Plots:**

1. **Y-axis (Features)**: Features ordered by importance (mean absolute SHAP value)
   - Top features have the largest impact on predictions
   - `s1` is most important, `age` is least important

2. **X-axis (SHAP Value)**: Impact on model output
   - **Positive values** (right of 0): Feature pushes prediction **higher**
   - **Negative values** (left of 0): Feature pushes prediction **lower**
   - **Zero**: No impact for that instance

3. **Color (Feature Value)**: Actual feature value for each instance
   - **Red dots**: High feature values
   - **Blue dots**: Low feature values
   - **Pattern**: Red dots on the right = high values increase predictions

4. **Each Dot**: Represents one prediction instance
   - Spread shows how impact varies across instances
   - Clustering around zero = low importance

**Key Observations from the Plots:**

**Linear Model (Ridge) Plot:**
- `s1` shows the widest spread (most impactful) with clear positive correlation (red → right)
- `s5` and `bmi` also show strong positive impact
- `s2` and `s4` show inverse relationships (red → left, blue → right)
- `age` and `s6` cluster tightly around zero (minimal impact)

**Tree Model (XGBoost) Plot:**
- `bmi` is the top feature (tree models capture non-linear BMI effects)
- Different ranking than linear model (tree models find different patterns)
- Shows more complex interactions between features
- `s3` has stronger negative impact in tree model (non-linear relationship)

**Why Linear vs Tree Models Differ:**
- **Linear models**: Assume additive relationships (feature effects are independent)
- **Tree models**: Capture interactions and non-linear patterns (e.g., BMI might interact with other features differently)

### Notebook 05: Cross-Validation & Leakage ✅
**The Validation Trap** — Data leakage is the silent killer of model insights. When training and test sets share information they shouldn't, metrics become misleading. GroupKFold and TimeSeriesSplit prevent this, ensuring our interpretations reflect reality.

**Key Concepts:**
- KFold vs GroupKFold vs TimeSeriesSplit
- Temporal and group-based leakage
- Conservative vs optimistic estimates

**Results:**
- **KFold vs GroupKFold**: Demonstrated group leakage in KFold (same groups in train and test)
- **GroupKFold**: Prevents leakage by keeping all measurements from the same group together
- **TimeSeriesSplit**: 
  - **Expanding Window Pattern**: Training set grows with each fold (20 → 35 → 52 → 68 → 83 samples)
  - **Future Test Sets**: Test sets are always chronologically after training (no temporal leakage)
  - **CV Metrics**: Mean RMSE = 11.63 ± 5.30, Mean R² = -0.62 ± 1.56
  - **Key Insight**: Test set is always in the future relative to training, simulating real-world deployment

**Key Takeaway**: 
- **KFold**: Wrong for grouped/temporal data (causes leakage)
- **GroupKFold**: Use when you have repeated measurements per entity (patients, players)
- **TimeSeriesSplit**: Use for time series data - ensures you use only past data to predict future

<div align="center">

<img src="images/05_timeseries_split.png" alt="TimeSeriesSplit Visualization" width="680" />

*TimeSeriesSplit demonstrates the expanding window pattern: training set grows with each fold, and test sets are always in the future (no temporal leakage)*

</div>

### Notebook 06: Summary & Reflection ✅

## 🧠 Core Concepts

### Why Interpretability Matters

In healthcare AI (like Periospot), interpretability isn't nice-to-have—it's a requirement. Clinicians need to understand why a model suggests a diagnosis. Regulators need to audit decisions. Patients deserve transparency.

But interpretability also makes you a better data scientist:
- **Debugging**: When a model fails, interpretability shows you where
- **Feature Engineering**: Understanding what matters guides new features
- **Trust**: Stakeholders trust models they can understand
- **Compliance**: Many regulations (GDPR, FDA) require explainability

### The Four Pillars

1. **Permutation Importance** — Model-agnostic, intuitive, fast. Best for initial feature ranking.
2. **Regularization** — Built into training, prevents overfitting, Lasso selects features.
3. **PCA** — Diagnostic tool for redundancy, dimensionality reduction, visualization.
4. **SHAP** — Local and global explanations, theoretically grounded, model-specific.

Each has strengths and weaknesses. The dojo teaches you when to use which.

- **Model**: XGBRegressor (n_estimators=200, max_depth=3, random_state=42)
- **Explainer**: TreeExplainer (fast, exact for tree models)
- **Test Sample**: 89 rows

**Key Findings:**
- **Linear Model Feature Importance** (by mean absolute SHAP value):
  1. **`s1`**: 33.17 — Most impactful feature
  2. **`s5`**: 28.79 — Second most important
  3. **`bmi`**: 22.83 — Third most important
  4. **`s2`**: 18.96 — Fourth
  5. **`bp`**: 13.53 — Fifth
- **Tree Model Top Features**: `bmi`, `s5`, `s3` (captures non-linear interactions differently than linear model)
- **SHAP vs Permutation Importance Comparison**:
  - **Strong Agreement**: 4 out of 5 top features overlap (`s1`, `s5`, `bmi`, `s2`)
  - **Differences**: 
    - SHAP ranks `bp` #5 (local impact for specific predictions)
    - Permutation ranks `sex` #5 (global impact on overall model performance)
  - **Interpretation**: SHAP captures per-prediction contributions, while permutation importance measures overall model impact
- **Directionality Analysis**:
  - **Positive Impact Features**: `s1`, `s5`, `bmi`, `bp` — high values increase predictions
  - **Negative Impact Features**: `s2`, `s4` — high values decrease predictions (inverse relationship)
- **Key Insight**: SHAP provides both magnitude (how much) and direction (positive/negative) of feature contributions, offering richer interpretability than permutation importance alone. Tree models reveal different feature interactions than linear models.

**Plot Interpretations:**

**Linear Model SHAP Plot (`04_shap_linear_summary.png`):**
- **Feature Ranking**: `s1` (33.17) > `s5` (28.79) > `bmi` (22.83) > `s2` (18.96) > `bp` (13.53)
- **Visual Pattern**: `s1` shows widest horizontal spread (most variable impact across instances)
- **Directionality**: Red dots (high values) on right = positive correlation; red dots on left = negative correlation
- **Key Finding**: `s2` and `s4` show inverse relationships (high values decrease predictions)

**Tree Model SHAP Plot (`04_shap_tree_summary.png`):**
- **Feature Ranking**: `bmi` > `s5` > `s3` (different from linear model!)
- **Visual Pattern**: `bmi` is top feature (tree models capture non-linear BMI effects)
- **Key Finding**: Tree models reveal `bmi` as most important, showing how non-linear models find different patterns than linear models
- **Comparison**: Tree model shows `s3` has stronger negative impact than in linear model

**SHAP vs Permutation Importance Comparison:**
- **Agreement (4/5 features)**: Both methods identify `s1`, `s5`, `bmi`, `s2` as critical
- **Disagreement**: SHAP prefers `bp` (#5), Permutation prefers `sex` (#5)
- **Why Different**: 
  - SHAP measures **local impact** (per-prediction contributions)
  - Permutation measures **global impact** (overall model performance change)
  - `bp` may have high local impact for specific instances but less overall impact
  - `sex` may have consistent moderate impact across all predictions

**Artifacts**:
- SHAP summary plot (linear): `images/04_shap_linear_summary.png` — Shows feature importance and directionality for Ridge regression
- SHAP summary plot (tree): `images/04_shap_tree_summary.png` — Shows non-linear feature interactions in XGBoost
- Feature importance rankings with directionality (positive/negative impact)
- Comparison table: SHAP vs Permutation Importance (4/5 features agree)

  - **Key Insight**: Test set is always in the future relative to training, ensuring no temporal leakage
- **When to Use Each**:
  - **KFold**: Independent samples, no groups, no time order
  - **GroupKFold**: Repeated measurements per entity (patients, players, customers)
  - **TimeSeriesSplit**: Time series data, temporal sequences

**Artifacts**:
- KFold vs GroupKFold comparison showing group leakage
- TimeSeriesSplit visualization: `images/05_timeseries_split.png`
- Fold-by-fold metrics and expanding window pattern demonstration
